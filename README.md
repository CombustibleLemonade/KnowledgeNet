KnowledgeNet
============

An e-learning replacement for some school courses, using an achievement system to organise data.

The system will feature an achievement system, where each "achievement" is a small bit of information. Almost every bit of information is dependent on previous bits of information, and unlocks following bits of information. This allows mappping dependencies between information such that flexibility in the approach to learning the information is in no way compromised.
Each achievement will consist of one explanatory part, and one questionnaire, polling wether the user has sufficiently understood the information in the explanatory part.
